# Single-Spa Microfrontend Architecture Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the single-spa microfrontend architecture used in this application. The documentation covers various aspects of the architecture, deployment strategies, and data flow patterns.

## Contents

1. [Architecture Overview](architecture.md)
   - System architecture diagram
   - Core components
   - Technology stack
   - Detailed component descriptions

2. [Deployment Architecture](deployment-architecture.md)
   - Deployment strategy
   - CI/CD pipeline
   - Versioning approach
   - Blue-green deployment strategy
   - Rollback mechanisms

3. [Data Flow Architecture](data-flow.md)
   - Communication patterns
   - Event bus implementation
   - State management
   - Data persistence strategies
   - Security considerations

4. [Architecture Diagram](architecture-diagram.puml)
   - PlantUML source file for the architecture diagram
   - Can be rendered using any PlantUML compatible tool

## Key Architecture Principles

1. **Microfrontend Independence**
   - Each microfrontend can be developed, tested, and deployed independently
   - Teams can work autonomously on their respective microfrontends

2. **Shared Common Infrastructure**
   - Common utilities and services are shared via the shared module
   - Consistent patterns for cross-microfrontend communication

3. **Technology Consistency**
   - Angular as the framework for all microfrontends
   - RxJS for reactive programming and communication
   - TypeScript for type safety across the codebase

4. **User Experience Cohesion**
   - Despite the distributed architecture, the user experiences a single cohesive application
   - Consistent styling and interaction patterns

## How to Use This Documentation

- Start with the [Architecture Overview](architecture.md) to understand the high-level structure
- Review the [Data Flow Architecture](data-flow.md) to understand how components communicate
- Examine the [Deployment Architecture](deployment-architecture.md) for release management insights

## Contributing to the Architecture

When extending or modifying this architecture, please adhere to the following guidelines:

1. Maintain the separation of concerns between microfrontends
2. Update the documentation to reflect architectural changes
3. Follow established patterns for cross-microfrontend communication
4. Ensure proper testing of integration points between microfrontends

## Visualization

To visualize the PlantUML diagram:
1. Use an online PlantUML renderer like [PlantUML Server](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml/)
2. Use IDE plugins for VS Code, IntelliJ, etc.
3. Use the PlantUML command-line tool
